# Sport-Apparel Industry Investment Report
## Executive Summary 
The purpose of our study is to discuss the investment options within the sports apparel industry and make a recommendation for investing. We are paying attention to not only the financial ratios of the companies, but also their potential to grow in the long run. Two companies we will investigate in particular are Lululemon and Under Armour. Within the competitive sportswear industry, we believe there are still opportunities for companies to thrive. Lululemon and Under Armour are great examples of those which recently became the leading companies in the sportswear industry. As we perform further analysis of these two companies, we wish to gain an in-depth understanding of their different paths to success. In detail, we will examine Lululemon and Under Armour's business framework and financial ratios, and perform SWOT Analysis on each of the companies. Afterward, an industry comparison including three other competitors within the sportswear industry will be shown. From there, we wish to make our final recommendation for investment, based on financial performance and long-term growth potential.  
## Introduction 
As members of the investment club, our group wishes to explore new pathways for investment. Our recommended company for investment should not only yield high returns in the short term but also have unlimited future growth potential. Apart from the traditional clothing industry, we have chosen the sportswear sector to be our area of interest.  

As the market size of the sports apparel industry was valued at over 150 billion US dollars in 2018, it is a giant industry of its own. The industry of sportswear is quite saturated and competitive, as it has been dominated by traditional well-known brands, such as Nike, and Adidas. Although the market is competitive, we still believe that there exist many opportunities for smaller companies to thrive. The truth is, despite the obstacles, several companies have made their way to the top, joining Nike and Adidas, becoming the leading companies in the industry.  

Two of those companies which recently claimed their place among the big names are Lululemon and Under Armour, which are our primary target companies for further analysis. Both companies have adopted drastically different marketing approaches and business strategies to achieve the positions they have today. We will also investigate further within the sportswear industry to include three other competitors of Lululemon and Under Armour to form our industry comparison, which can lead to our final recommendation.  
## Analysis
### Lululemon 
Lululemon Athletica Inc. is a yoga-inspired athletic apparel company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Founded in 1998, the company has been designing, manufacturing, and selling athletic clothing and accessories for women, men, boys and girls. Lululemon has become one of the most popular fitness clothing brands in the world, and its success can be attributed to its mission, vision, objectives, strategies, business model and strong financial ratios. 

### Mission and Vision
“Lululemon’s Mission is to Elevate Human Potential by Helping People Feel their Best.”

“Lululemon’s Vision is to Create Transformative Products and Experiences that Build Meaningful Connections, Unlocking Greater Possibility and Wellbeing for all.”  

Lululemon seeks to empower people to live and work out with intention, to connect with their community, and to be mindful of their personal and global impact. This is exactly why Lululemon was founded, the founder Chip Wilson initially wanted to help people wear decent and comfortable yoga gear to unlock their potential.
### Objectives and Impacts
Lululemon has three objectives to address its vision: Product Innovation, Guest Experience, and Market Expansion, along with their three impacts: Be Human, Be Well, and Be Planet. The six goals are concluded by Lululemon as “Power of Three *2.”

They aim to create innovative and high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers; to build a guest-centric experience that creates connections, celebrates products, and cultivates community; and to expand the international market that introduces Lululemon to new guests and communities around the world.

Under the three objectives that are more related to their business, Lululemon’s impacts are the true power that creates their successful business and shows their responsibility to impact the world and society as a whole. 

They envision an equitable world and take thoughtful steps toward a more equitable future so their guests, employees, ambassadors, and business partners, including the people who make their products feel represented, welcome, respected, and valued. 

Moreover, they recognize that planetary health is a fundamental condition for well-being; for humanity; for business. The Lululemon Centre for Social Impact, which launched in 2021 with a commitment of US $75 million by 2025, is leveraging its business, expertise, resources, and communities to invest in and advocate for the well-being of those most impacted by systemic inequity around the world. 

Additionally, they’ve also set science-based targets for their climate action goals. They seek to lead in innovating more sustainable materials and working toward a circular ecosystem by designing out waste and keeping materials in use for as long as possible. They work across their value chain to reduce carbon, waste, and water footprint, improve chemicals management, develop and sell products that reflect the values of guests, and contribute to a healthier world.

### Strategies
Lululemon has implemented several strategies to achieve its objectives. They market themselves as a lifestyle, rather than a product, as Lululemon promotes their products as stepping stones to an active and enjoyable lifestyle. 

They price their product at a premium price, which is 20 - 30% higher than the industry average. The price gap is the strategy to differentiate their brand and products from competitors. Apart from the price, the company also focuses on product innovation and quality, creating products that are both stylish and functional. 

They also focus on customer experience, creating a welcoming and comfortable environment in their stores and online. Additionally, Lululemon has invested in marketing and advertising to increase brand awareness and loyalty. Earlier this year, Lululemon launched its loyalty program to reward customers for their purchases and ongoing engagement with the brand. Members of the program receive personalised rewards, early access to products and in-store events. Customers can earn points when they purchase items in-store or online, refer a friend, or take part in special activities. Points can be redeemed for exclusive discounts, free shipping & return, and access to exclusive collections and events.

Lululemon is one of the few companies that can well control the power of influence on social media, people love to share their outfits and Lulu’s gear and clothes. This is a win-win for both sides, as the company improves brand reputation and customers gain identity from friends or even strangers. Lululemon has also signed up with more than 500+ sports ambassadors around the world, greatly enhancing the brand's image in various fields.

### Business Model
Lululemon follows an omnichannel sales business model, selling products in both physical stores and online. They also sell its products to wholesale customers such as health clubs, fitness centres, and yoga studios. This allows the company to reach a wider audience and increase its sales. 

The company offers a wide range of products, including clothing such as pants, tops, shorts, and jackets that people can wear as they engage in fitness activities such as running and yoga. In addition to clothes, the company also sells accessories such as bags, socks, and yoga mats.

Lululemon does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities but instead relies on a network of suppliers, to provide the fabrics and materials needed to produce their products. They work closely with their suppliers to create quality products that meet the company’s high standards. Outsourcing all production reduces heavy asset investment and gives the company a healthy cash flow to focus more on designing products, as well as innovations.

## Financial Ratios
### Activity Ratios
Inventory turnover is one of the efficiency ratios measuring how effectively a company uses its assets and is especially important for retailers. A company can then divide the days in the period, typically a fiscal year, by the inventory turnover ratio to calculate how many days it takes to sell its inventory, on average. Lululemon’s inventory turnover declined in 2016 and remained at 3.6 to 3.8. It may not look dramatic on the numbers, but if we convert the current number into days, the inventory turnover increased from 85 days to over 100. The increase is almost a month. Given the cost of goods sold increased in 2016, it can be inferred that the average value of inventory went down significantly. This could be caused by either their excessive inventory or low demand. In 2015, Lululemon recalled 318000 dangerous women’s tops across the U.S. and Canada following seven reported eye and face injuries from faulty drawstrings. According to a notice from the American government’s Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least 20 styles of Lululemon jackets and hooded tops — all with elastic drawstrings at the neck — have been deemed hazardous. So lower demand was more likely the cause. But overall, there is nothing to worry about because even at the lowest point, the number was still about the same as the industry level. The only minor concern is the downward trend. Lululemon would need to come up with a new strategy to turn this trend around and reduce costs.
<img width="313" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 31 13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153769-5ac384d3-fe1e-471d-8392-b60bf01f11e0.png">

Asset turnover measures the value of a company's sales or revenues relative to the value of its assets. It could be used as an indicator of how efficient a company is in utilizing its assets to generate revenue. Lululemon’s asset turnover fluctuated between 1.3 and 1.6, but only exceeded the industry average in 2019 by a small amount, which indicated that the efficiency of generating revenue using assets is just at the industry average level. Given the fact the total revenues of each year from 2015 and 2019 were constantly increasing at a fairly fast pace, we conclude that the fluctuation was mainly caused by the change in total assets.

### Liquidity Ratios
Generally, a higher current ratio is preferred. However, in the real world, a high current ratio also means the ability to manage working capital could be improved, closer to the industry average number is desirable.
Lululemon has a much higher than average current ratio in 2015, and also had fluctuation during the past five years just like asset turnover. If we compare this chart with the asset turnover chart, we can see that they are telling us the same story. The current ratio decreased in 2016, whereas the asset turnover increased in 2016. From 2016 to 2018, the current ratio increased, and asset turnover increased. Again, in 2019, the current ratio declined and was closer to the average, meanwhile, the asset turnover outperformed the industry in 2019. To conclude, they are both suggesting that Lululemon was having a better capability of utilizing current assets and properly managing its working capital.

<img width="561" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 32 33" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153805-55c228a1-5ff3-43da-b36c-8ae54d5eec2c.png">

Profitability Ratios
Net profit margin is one of the most important indicators of a company's financial standing. Since one financial ratio cannot tell a good story alone, we will compare Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Profit Margin together to ensure we can see the whole picture. All three indicators are consistently above the industry average and showed either a stale or upward trend overall. All three charts look very good and healthy, with no significant fluctuations or downward trends, which means the company was always profitable, and the profit was increasing each year.

<img width="675" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 32 53" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153816-27f3da50-cb10-4962-80db-62d346fa2c72.png">

### SWOT Analysis 
Strengths  
Lululemon has successfully combined the concept of Yoga and its brand and become the go-to brand for stylish and professional yoga-related products. Lululemon’s marketing strategy is an advantage as well. Active social media platform activities let the customers feel closer to the brand. 

Weakness  
The combination of yoga and Lululemon could also be a weakness since it limits the ability to expand the product lines. Besides, the relatively high price may limit the target customer group. Even though Lululemon has been opening new retail stores in different countries, the majority of its income still comes from North America, as its international presence is still limited.

Opportunities  
The changing world brings opportunities and threats at the same time. The world is adapting to a more healthy and more active lifestyle, and customers are becoming more conscious about the environment. More importantly, sports fashion also becomes a trend which suits the target market of Lululemon, as these elements combined resonate with what Lululemon has been doing the whole time.

Threats   
The premium price is a major threat. As the industry is quite saturated, new intruders would potentially enter the market with a much lower price to gain more market share. Plus, decreasing inventory turnover also correlates with the high pricing strategy. If Lululemon would like to maintain a high-end product image and high sales price, some new strategies would be essential.

## Under Armour
### Vision Statement
“To inspire you with performance solutions you never knew you needed and can’t imagine living without.”  
 
The vision statement of Under Armour expresses its ambition to innovate, inspire and influence. The company’s ongoing objective to provide cutting-edge products that improve athletic performance is demonstrated by this statement. Illustrating Under Armour’s goal, the vision statement shows Under Armour's commitment to identifying athletes’ demands and offering solutions that are beyond imagination.  

### Mission Statement
“Under Armour Makes You Better.”  
 
In its concise mission statement, Under Armour states its purpose to “make you better”, where “you” refers to everyone who might be impacted by the brand beyond the athletes who use its products.  Apart from producing innovative products, Under Armour is also dedicated to promoting equality and acting sustainably to build an inclusive and sustainable community. These objectives serve as Under Armour’s guiding principles that shape the company culture and help to direct the company’s storyline.   

## Objectives 
Under Armour aspires to identify issues and offer inventive performance solutions to empower athletes. It possesses leading research and development teams, which pushes product innovation and subsequently the boundaries of performance enhancement. Two crucial quantitative and qualitative indicators of the company’s progress are revenue and customer reviews.  
 
Another goal of Under Armour is to extend its business into women’s and children’s apparel and footwear to expand its market share. It is also a strategy for increasing product diversification. The brand’s consumer demographics and sales in women's and children’s product lines can be used as key measures to monitor this progress. 
 
Under Armour’s progress in data science development to drive innovation and customer experience can be measured through the growth of sales, customer satisfaction and retention. These metrics indicate the effectiveness of Under Armour’s data analytical models in detecting market trends, as well as in regulating product development and quality to ensure the company’s products align with market demands while maintaining superior quality. 

## Business Model 
The production and sale of apparel, footwear, and accessories with a focus on enhancing athletic performance constitute Under Armour’s primary line of business and revenue stream. The company’s products are mostly marketed to young to middle-aged consumers who are highly health-concerned and passionate about fitness. A competitive strategy Under Armour uses to enhance market penetration is through athlete ambassadors and sponsorships, which attract target customers and position the brand as a professional sportswear brand. Moreover, to reach its customers, Under Armour adopted multiple sales and distribution channels. The two major ones are wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, which contributed 57% and 41% of the company’s net revenues, respectively [1]. 
 Due to the comparatively high quality and functionality of the majority of its products, Under Armour employs a value-based pricing model to charge a premium price compared to other sportswear competitors. This pricing approach also implies that Under Armour’s target market is made up of consumers with ample financial resources. Under Armour’s pricing is well-accepted by its target market as a result of its competitive strategy of product differentiation in terms of textiles. The innovative and advanced technologies used in fabrics and materials, such as heat gear and cold gear, can help enhance performance, and distinguish the brand from its competitors. 
 
Furthermore, Under Armour’s supply chain architecture relies on a small number of suppliers to maintain consistency in raw material quality. The company’s strategic relationship with a stable group of suppliers not only ensures raw material quality but also strengthens Under Armour’s bargaining power. By ordering a high volume of materials from a limited number of suppliers, Under Armour can negotiate for lower commodity prices to reduce its costs of goods sold. A crucial strategy that Under Armour employs to mitigate the risk of supplier failure is diversification. To avoid supply chain disruptions caused by unanticipated national issues such as economic downturns or agricultural failure, Under Armour selects its suppliers from a diverse range of locations.  

## Financial Ratios
### Activity Ratios
As presented in the following chart, the Inventory Turnover of Under Armour was below average from 2015 to 2019 consistently. This indicates that the inventory management of Under Armour was not efficient enough, and an excessive amount of resources were occupied by their inventory.
 
The turnover increased and reached 2.81 by the end of 2016. This can be well explained by their efforts to make better sales. For example, Under Armour started a partnership with Stephen Curry in the 2013 offseason; provided speedskaters’ suits in the 2014 Winter Olympics; became the official partner of the North American Soccer League in March 2016; announced a 15-year plan of sponsorship with UCLA in the same year [2]. The various sponsorship initiatives of Under Armour have earned them an extensive brand presence, resulting in high sales and a continuing flow of inventory replenishment.
 
Then the inventory turnover decreased to 2.36 in 2017, as many events took place. For instance, the bankruptcy of the retail giants, Sports Authority and Sport Chalet, was beyond their control and had adverse effects on their inventory replenishment. However, Under Armour recovered quickly from this blow and continued to increase. As another NBA player Joel Embiid was signed as their sneaker ambassador, their inventory turnover grew to 3.13 by the end of 2019.
<img width="584" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 36 14" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153915-d629981c-5f34-40ca-aacf-438c71311a93.png">

The Receivables Turnover of Under Armour was quite stable; however, it was noticeably smaller than the industry average, during the 5-year period, where it fluctuated in the range of 7.43 and 9.14. This indicates a slower-than-average outstanding bills collection strategy of Under Armour. Nonetheless, by comparing with competitors other than Lululemon, their credit policy was around the industry level.

Under Armour’s Asset Turnover was always below the industry average, as it decreased from 1.3829 to 1.0875 in the given period. This trend illustrated that Under Armour was not efficiently generating revenues with its total assets. This is not desired by investors, since we must carefully evaluate how well the companies can utilize their limited assets and our potential investment.

### Liquidity Ratios 
The Current Ratio of Under Armour was decreasing from 3.13 to 1.90, fluctuating around the industry average. This trend represents Under Armour’s ability to liquidate its liquid assets to pay off short-term liabilities, which meets the approximate industry average. However, considering their Inventory Turnover, the satisfactory performance of their Current Ratio might be attributed to their excess inventory.

### Profitability Ratios

<img width="584" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 37 21" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153955-10fd2e5b-ad04-4d15-bace-f7ebed2ebe63.png">

All profitability ratios demonstrate similar decreasing trends by 2017, where they were stabilized from 2017 to 2018, and increased from 2018 to 2019. The Gross Profit Margin decreased from 48.08 to 45.13 by the end of 2017, which then increased from 45.07 to 46.90 after 2018, fluctuating around the industry average. The generated revenue and the CoGs of Under Armour seemed healthy overall. On the other hand, the Operating Profit Margin was below average, decreasing from 10.30 to 0.56 by the end of 2017, and increasing from -0.48 to 4.495 after 2018. Given that Under Armour had a normal Gross Income, they might have spent too much on operations.

The performances of Under Armour in Net Profit Margin, ROA and ROE were similar, as all ratios were below-average during the 5-year period, with negative values in 2017 and 2018. That is an undesired signal for potential investors since the three ratios indicate that Under Armour did not have satisfactory abilities to turn sales into shareholders’ earnings, efficiently utilize their assets, or return to the investment of shareholders by earning back income for them. To summarize, Under Armour had no advantages in making profits, compared to other companies in the industry. This can be attributed to the unimpressive or unprofessional design of some important products like Curry 3 series shoes, which only cost from them without earning back. Being criticized by experts, some product designs were refused by their sponsored athletes in college teams, with worries of injuries. Lastly, a possible reason for the increase in these ratios after 2018 might be the administration shuffle starting in that year. As a result of the executive shuffle, the former CEO Kevin Plank left Under Armour eventually.
<img width="584" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 37 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153964-ec277b9e-0e84-48bf-b037-a073cde0ba8d.png">

### SWOT Analysis 
Strengths  
Even though Under Armour has not been performing outstandingly in the stock market for years, its share price has been on the rise recently. Moreover, Under Armour is a leading company in digital applications among companies in the sportswear industry. Their digital apps like MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal and Endomondo can improve the user experience and adapt the company to the age of information. Additionally, they sell and sponsor a wide variety of products, including apparel and equipment for ball games, swimming, skating, auto racing, boxing, etc. Based on the inventory turnover, they have sufficient inventory to be sold. Under Armour also has a remarkable network of distribution channels, including wholesale, direct consumer sales, licensing, etc. Under Armour’s product variety and distribution channels have gained the company a large customer base. Finally, as mentioned above, they have been the official outfitter for many players and events, including college teams, professional players, sports associations and events like Winter Olympics. These sponsorships can improve the brand presence and impact of Under Armour.

Weaknesses  
Instead of improving their products and operational efficiency, Under Armour has been investing too much, and the high expenditures in these investments also raise the risks of the company's poor financial standing. Furthermore, Under Armour has not adopted the e-commerce trend well. Most of their core customers have been used to their policy of in-store purchases and slow payments. In this case, it will be difficult for Under Armour to shift to e-commerce. Besides, most of the revenue is generated from North America, so they heavily rely on the market there. Their international market is relatively new and thus requires more development. As discussed in the financial ratios section, the financial performances of Under Armour do not have advantages over the other companies in the industry.

Opportunities  
As mentioned, Under Armour is slow on adopting e-commerce and global market development, so e-commerce adoption and international market expansion can be opportunities for Under Armour to improve its sales and revenue generation. Under Armour can also improve its products and corresponding marketing strategies to cope with the trend of sustainability.

Threats  
Under Armour produces a wide variety of products, but they are not outstanding in product uniqueness. As discussed above, the design and quality of some products were not professional enough to be worn in training. Therefore, Under Armour’s products can be easily substituted by similar products of the competitors. Also, during the upcoming recession, specifically after all these years of COVID-19, the financial performance of the entire industry will be negatively affected, as the consumer power of the whole society will be reduced. Lastly, the public reactions to the controversial political actions by their executives would be another threat to Under Armour. After their former CEO Kevin Plank publicly supported President Trump, their brand image and brand reputation have been greatly affected, which also reduced their profitability.

## Industry comparison 
To form a more in-depth understanding of how Lululemon and Under Armour are performing, we decided to compare them against three other competitors, Adidas, Nike and Gap. Averaging the financial ratios of all five companies, we created a benchmark for further comparison, denoted as the industry average. As detailed financial ratios are discussed previously, in this section, we are focusing on a few iconic ones.
<img width="696" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 38 54" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226153997-ad06b67c-fd2b-436e-b9c8-3565aaca6963.png">

### Receivable Turnover
Firstly, we are examining the graph of receivable turnovers. As Figure 4.1 presents, there is a significant difference in receivable turnover between Lululemon and the rest of the industry, where Lululemon fluctuates between 90 and 250, and the rest of the industry is around 8 to 10. We conclude that this is a result of the extremely strict credit policy which Lululemon has implemented, which means Lululemon collects its account receivable immensely fast compared to the others in the industry. The upside of this phenomenon is that Lululemon has a healthy cash flow, whereas the downside is strict credit sales can scare off customers, especially those purchasing in bulk. Usually, an uncommonly high receivable turnover is a point to be cautious about when investing; however, in the case of Lululemon, based on its positive financial standing, we can simply consider this as a unique characteristic of Lululemon’s operation. 

### Net Profit Margin
Net profit margin is one of the most important indicators of a company’s profitability. Figure 4.2 shows that Lululemon is the top company in this regard, with Nike following in second place. The other companies are all falling behind, which indicates their general ability to profit from each dollar of revenue is lacking compared to Lululemon and Nike. Under Armour, in particular, is underperforming as it is significantly below the industry average, even resulting in negative values for net profit margins in 2017 and 2018. Therefore, we are excluding Under Armour from our choice of investment, as it has shown poor profitability compared to the rest of the industry.

### Return on Asset (ROA)
Lastly, we also wish to examine the efficiency of companies' operations utilizing limited assets. As Figure 4.3 shows the comparison of Return on Asset (ROA) between the five companies, Lululemon again tops the chart with Nike following in second place. This suggests that Lululemon and Nike are two of the leading sportswear companies, which not only have high profitability but also good efficiency when it comes to utilizing limited assets to generate profit. 

### Conclusion 
Hence, from the industry comparison of the financial ratios, we conclude that Lululemon and Nike are the two companies which are worth investing in, as both choices have shown high profitability and efficiency in their operation. We will conduct a further investigation into which company to invest in through the following section.

## Further Analysis of Lululemon VS. Nike

As stated in the previous section, Lululemon and Nike are two of the potential choices for investment based on the financial ratios. We wish to investigate further which company is truly our pick for investment; therefore, we have created the heat maps, which compare Lululemon directly against Nike in financial ratios. Within the heap maps, where a cell is red, it means Lulullemon is better than Nike in that particular financial ratio, and green means that Nike is better in that regard. Plus, as colours become darker, one company is significantly better than the other. 
<img width="605" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 40 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226154066-3ed95ccb-3beb-4f9c-af0e-46e1791893ed.png">
As shown in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2, the vast majority of the financial ratios are in favour of Lululemon, except inventory turnover in 2018, and 2019, asset turnover across the years, and more importantly return on equity. Regarding inventory turnover and asset turnover, although Nike is better than Lululemon, the two companies' ratios are still close. The return on equity shows that Nike is more efficient than Lululemon at utilizing equity financing to produce profit, which is a great characteristic to consider for investment. To conclude, both Nike and Lululemon are great choices for investment, but Lululemon has shown a more rapid trend for growth as shown across all graphs; therefore, we choose Lululemon as our choice for investment based on financial ratios.

## Recommendation 
<img width="372" alt="截屏2023-03-19 00 41 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100692852/226154079-12a3990b-7e83-4be4-a990-48bb2008143b.png">
Our final recommendation for investment is Lululemon, as it not only has the best financial performance among its competitors, but also possesses the most amount of potential to grow in the future. In Figure 6.1, a timeline for Lululemon’s development is displayed. Looking at the grand scheme of Lululemon’s history, the company is always moving toward the right direction. Not only has the company started to show its international presence in 2013, but it also established its luxurious fashion brand, “Lab”, in 2019. Lululemon is truly combining the concept of sportswear and fashion, defining a new clothing category of its own, Sports Fashion. Within this new category, there are rarely any other clothing companies that can compete with Lululemon, as it has almost become the singular thriving company in this category. We also believe sports fashion is the future trend. As the functionality of sportswear is fulfilled, customers are becoming more and more conscious of the fashionable apparel of the products, where Lululemon becomes the go-to brand. Lululemon has been successfully tying the concept of a healthy and active lifestyle to its brand. Combining the successful marketing strategy with its strong product lines, we believe Lululemon will continue to thrive in the future. Therefore, Lululemon is the choice of investment, not only in the short run but also in the long run.
